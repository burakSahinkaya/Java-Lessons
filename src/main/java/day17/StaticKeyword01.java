        Question 1: How do you use non static things inside the "main" method
                   there are 2 ways
                   i)Make it static
                   ii)create a object then by the help of the object
                      use it in "main" method
        Question 2: How do you access to static and non-static things from outside the class
                 (LOOK AT THE StaticKeyword02 )
                    i) Just class name  is enough to access static things
                    ii) To access non-static things you have to create object
