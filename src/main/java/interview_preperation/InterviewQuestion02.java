    What is the differences between abstract class and interface
    1) methods : i) "abstract class" can have both abstract and concrete methods
                     interfaces can have just abstract methods.
                     note: We can create methods with body b using default or static
                 ii) Methods in abstract class can use any access modifier
                     methods in interace are definitely public
    2) Variables: i) abstract class can have every type of variable
                     interface can have public static and final variables
    3) Note : By the help of the interfaces we can create multiple parents for class but
              when you use abstract classes it is impossible to create multiple parents for a class
    4) Class extends class, Interface extends Interface, Class implements Interface,
       Interface can not be the child of a class
